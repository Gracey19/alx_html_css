# SmileSchool Homepage – CSS Advanced Project

Welcome to my CSS Advanced project for the ALX Software Engineering program! This responsive homepage is built entirely with HTML and CSS, based on the SmileSchool design provided in Figma.

# Project Objectives

- Recreate the SmileSchool homepage using semantic HTML and clean CSS
- Match the layout, typography, and spacing from the Figma design
- Apply advanced CSS techniques including Flexbox, Grid, and custom styling
- Ensure W3C-compliant code and proper file structure
- Practice manual QA review and peer feedback

# Design Reference

This project is based on the SmileSchool layout from Figma. I used:

- **Fonts**: [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) and [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle)
- **Assets**: Images and icons provided in the ALX resources
- **Structure**: Header, Banner, Testimonials, Quote, Tutorials, Membership, FAQ, and Footer

# Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Font Awesome (for icons)

# File Structure

## Notes

- Some Figma values were in float (e.g. 12.8px) – I rounded them for cleaner CSS
- I made relevant changes to the HTML including:
  - Added missing images and icons
  - Corrected structure and class names
  - Inserted all required content blocks

## Lessons Learned

- How to translate design specs into code
- How to structure HTML for maintainability
- How to centralize and reuse CSS styles
- How to QA and validate code for peer review

## Status

Complete  
Ready for manual QA review
